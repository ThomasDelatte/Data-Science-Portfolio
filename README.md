# Data Science Portfolio
 
A repository of the projects I worked on or currently working on. It is updated regularly. The projects are either written as Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) or as Python modules (.py). Click on the projects to see the full analysis and code.

For a more visually pleasant experience for browsing the portfolio and to read my articles, check out [thomasdelatte.com](https://thomasdelatte.com).

## Stand-alone Projects

### [GPT-2 EU text Generator](https://github.com/thomasdelatte/gpt2-eu-acts)
* [The OpenAI GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) exhibited impressive ability of writing coherent and passionate essays that exceed what we anticipated current language models are able to produce. 
* This is my own project using image recognition methods in practice. This is a site where user ... and machine learning models (based on GPT-2) will generate EU... using [GPT2-simple](https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple).
* To generate some text right away, you can try it [here](https://thomasdelatte.com/app).

## Micro Projects

### [Clustering with K-means](https://github.com/ThomasDelatte/Notebooks/blob/master/Clustering_with_K-Means.ipynb)
* A visual introduction and  to the K-Means algorithm. 
* For a more visually pleasing experience, you can find my article [here](https://thomasdelatte.com/2020/04/kmeans/).

### [Pulsars Detection with HTRU2 Dataset](https://github.com/ThomasDelatte/Notebooks/blob/master/Pulsars_HTRU2.ipynb)
* The HTRU2 Pulsars dataset contains data about pulsars. I first use the dataset as a binary classification problem, and as an opportunity to try different classification algorithms and compare their performance.
* Then, I use the dataset for unsupervised learning tasks, namely by using a clustering method (K-Means) with PCA as a precursor step.
